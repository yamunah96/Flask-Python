FLASK CORE CONCEPTS USED IN THIS PROJECT
======================================

1. redirect()
--------------
redirect() is used to send the user from one route to another route.
It helps control navigation flow after actions like login, logout,
signup, or account deactivation.

Example use:
- Redirect user to dashboard after login
- Redirect user to login page after logout

Importance:
- Improves user experience
- Prevents reloading sensitive pages
- Ensures proper application flow


2. url_for()
-------------
url_for() dynamically generates URLs for Flask routes using function names.
It avoids hardcoding URLs.

Example:
redirect(url_for("SignIn"))

Importance:
- Prevents broken links
- Makes code maintainable
- Automatically updates URLs if route names change


3. request
-----------
request is used to access incoming HTTP request data such as form inputs,
query parameters, and request methods.

Used for:
- Reading form data (username, password, amount)
- Checking request method (GET or POST)

Importance:
- Enables user input handling
- Essential for form-based applications


4. Password Hashing (generate_password_hash, check_password_hash)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Password hashing converts a password into a secure, irreversible format.

Functions used:
- generate_password_hash(): stores hashed password
- check_password_hash(): verifies user password

Importance:
- Protects user passwords
- Prevents password theft even if database is compromised
- Industry-standard security practice


5. LoginManager
----------------
LoginManager is a Flask-Login component that manages user authentication.

Responsibilities:
- Tracks logged-in users
- Protects routes using @login_required
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login page

Importance:
- Central authentication control
- Secure session handling
- Simplifies login/logout logic


6. UserMixin
-------------
UserMixin provides default implementations required by Flask-Login.

It adds:
- is_authenticated
- is_active
- is_anonymous
- get_id()

Importance:
- Reduces boilerplate code
- Makes custom User class compatible with Flask-Login


7. @login_required
-------------------
@login_required restricts access to certain routes.
Only authenticated users can access those routes.

Used for:
- Dashboard
- Logout
- Deactivate account

Importance:
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Protects sensitive data


8. session
-----------
session is used to store user-specific data on the server.

Used in this project to:
- Store logged-in username
- Maintain user state

Importance:
- Maintains login state
- Improves performance
- Enhances user experience


9. Database Status Column (status)
----------------------------------
The status column controls whether a user account is active or inactive.

Values:
- 1 → Active account
- 0 → Deactivated account

Importance:
- Implements soft delete
- Prevents data loss
- Allows account reactivation
- Used as a security filter during login


10. Soft Deactivation
----------------------
Instead of deleting user data, the account is deactivated by setting status = 0.

Importance:
- Data integrity
- Audit tracking
- Professional banking-system design


11. Flask App Structure
-----------------------
The project uses a modular structure:
- app.py → routes & flow control
- bank.py → transaction logic
- user.py → authentication model
- database.py → DB operations

Importance:
- Clean architecture
- Easy maintenance
- Scalable design
12. load_user (User Loader)
----------------------------
load_user is a callback function required by Flask-Login.
It tells Flask-Login how to load a user from the database
using the stored user ID.

Syntax:
@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User(user_id)

Used for:
- Restoring logged-in user from session
- Maintaining login state across requests

Importance:
- Mandatory for Flask-Login
- Enables persistent login
- Without this, @login_required will not work


13. User Class
---------------
The User class represents the logged-in user.
It is used by Flask-Login to track authentication state.

Responsibilities:
- Stores user identity (username)
- Acts as bridge between session and database

Importance:
- Required for authentication
- Central user representation

14. Authentication
-------------------
Authentication is the process of verifying user identity.

Example:
- Checking username and password during login

In this project:
- Passwords are verified using password hashing
- Only valid users can log in

Importance:
- Confirms who the user is
- First layer of security


15. Authorization
------------------
Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

Example:
- Only logged-in users can access dashboard
- Only active users (status = 1) can log in

In this project:
- @login_required restricts route access
- status column controls account permissions

Importance:
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Controls user privileges
- Second layer of security


16. Authentication vs Authorization
-----------------------------------
Authentication → Who the user is  
Authorization → What the user can access  

Both are required for secure applications.


17. Flask-Login Session Handling
--------------------------------
Flask-Login manages user sessions securely.
It stores user ID in the session and reloads user
using load_user on every request.

Importance:
- Automatic session handling
- Secure login persistence
- Cleaner code


18. Why Flask-Login is Used Instead of Manual Sessions
-------------------------------------------------------
Flask-Login provides:
- Secure session management
- Route protection
- Built-in authentication helpers

Compared to manual sessions:
- Less error-prone
- More secure
- Industry-standard approach


19. Security Design Used in This Project
-----------------------------------------
- Password hashing instead of plain text
- Soft account deactivation using status
- Route protection with @login_required
- Session cleanup on logout and deactivation

Importance:
- Protects user data
- Follows real-world security practices
- Suitable for banking-type applications
